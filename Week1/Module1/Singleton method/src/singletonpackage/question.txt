Exercise 1: Implementing the Singleton Pattern
Scenario:
You need to ensure that a logging utility class in your application has only one instance throughout the application lifecycle to ensure consistent logging.
Steps:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
o	Create a new Java project named SingletonPatternExample.
2.	Define a Singleton Class:
o	Create a class named Logger that has a private static instance of itself.
o	Ensure the constructor of Logger is private.
o	Provide a public static method to get the instance of the Logger class.
3.	Implement the Singleton Pattern:
o	Write code to ensure that the Logger class follows the Singleton design pattern.
4.	Test the Singleton Implementation:
o	Create a test class to verify that only one instance of Logger is created and used across the application.
