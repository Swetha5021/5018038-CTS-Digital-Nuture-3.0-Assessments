Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem

Several data structures can be considered for implementing an inventory management system:

1. ArrayList: Suitable for dynamic arrays that allow for fast access and iteration. However, insertion and deletion can be
costly if the array needs to be resized or if elements need to be shifted.

2. HashMap: Provides average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. It is suitable for scenarios
where fast access based on a key (e.g., productId) is needed.

3. LinkedList: Good for scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required, but access times are slower (O(n)
for random access).

4. TreeMap: A Red-Black tree-based implementation of the Map interface. It provides O(log n) time complexity for insertions,
 deletions, and lookups, with the added benefit of maintaining sorted order.

 Time Complexity Analysis

 Add Product: O(1) on average. HashMap provides constant time complexity for insertion.
 Update Product: O(1) on average. Similar to insertion, updating a value in HashMap is constant time.
 Delete Product: O(1) on average. Deletion in HashMap is also constant time.
 Get Product: O(1) on average. Retrieval in HashMap is constant time.

 Optimization

 While HashMap is already efficient for the operations we need, further optimizations can include:

 * Load Factor Management: Tuning the load factor and initial capacity of the HashMap can help minimize rehashing
 operations and improve performance.
 * Concurrency: If the system needs to handle concurrent access, using ConcurrentHashMap can provide thread-safe operations
 without significant performance overhead.
 * Batch Operations: Implementing batch add, update, and delete operations can reduce the overhead of multiple individual
 operations, especially in a multi-threaded environment.

 By choosing HashMap, we ensure that our inventory management system can handle large datasets efficiently with constant
 time complexity for most operations, making it scalable and responsive.
