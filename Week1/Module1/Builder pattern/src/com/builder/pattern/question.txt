Exercise 3: Implementing the Builder Pattern
Scenario:
You are developing a system to create complex objects such as a Computer with multiple optional parts. Use the Builder Pattern to manage the construction process.
Steps:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
o	Create a new Java project named BuilderPatternExample.
2.	Define a Product Class:
o	Create a class Computer with attributes like CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.
3.	Implement the Builder Class:
o	Create a static nested Builder class inside Computer with methods to set each attribute.
o	Provide a build() method in the Builder class that returns an instance of Computer.
4.	Implement the Builder Pattern:
o	Ensure that the Computer class has a private constructor that takes the Builder as a parameter.
5.	Test the Builder Implementation:
o	Create a test class to demonstrate the creation of different configurations of Computer using the Builder pattern.
