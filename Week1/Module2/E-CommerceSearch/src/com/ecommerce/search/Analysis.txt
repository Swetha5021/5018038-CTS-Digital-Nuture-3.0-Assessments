Big O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It
characterizes the performance of an algorithm as the input size grows. Big O notation helps in analyzing and
comparing the efficiency of different algorithms by providing an upper limit on the running time or space requirements
in the worst-case scenario.

Time Complexity Comparison

1. Linear Search: O(n)

Best-case: O(1) if the element is the first one in the array.
Average-case: O(n/2) which simplifies to O(n).
Worst-case: O(n) if the element is at the end or not present.

2. Binary Search: O(log n)

Best-case: O(1) if the middle element is the target.
Average-case: O(log n).
Worst-case: O(log n) if the element is not present or found after log n comparisons.
Suitability for the Platform

For an e-commerce platform, where search operations are frequent and need to be fast, binary search is generally more
suitable due to its logarithmic time complexity. However, binary search requires the data to be sorted. This initial
sorting step can be a one-time overhead that pays off with much faster search times for subsequent operations.
